## Description 
Restaurant Menu App is a full-stack MEN (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) application that allows restaurant owners to manage menu items and customers to view menus and leave reviews. Admins can create, edit, and delete menu items, while customers can write, edit, and delete their own reviews. The app uses session-based authentication and role-based authorization to protect user data.

## Background 
This project was built as part of a MEN Stack CRUD application assignment. The goal was to practice building a full-stack application with authentication, authorization, and relational data while following RESTful conventions.
